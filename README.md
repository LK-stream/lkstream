# ü™Å LKSTREAM

**LKSTREAM** (Lightweight Kafka Stream) is a **lightweight, Kafka-like event streaming library and service**.  
It provides **topics, partitions, offsets, and persistence** ‚Äî without the heavy ops of running a full Kafka cluster.  

LKSTREAM is designed for **trading systems, IoT gateways, and real-time apps** where you need **replayable event logs** but want **simplicity and low latency**.

## ‚ùì Why LKSTREAM

Running Apache Kafka is **overkill for small/medium use cases**:
- Requires **clusters, ZooKeeper, ops team**.  
- Heavy on **infra, memory, and CPU**.  
- Steep **learning curve** for developers.  

**LKSTREAM** gives you the **same event streaming semantics** in a **single lightweight package**:
- Perfect for **solo developers, startups, edge computing**.  
- Drop it into your trading app or IoT pipeline in minutes.  
- Scale later ‚Üí bridge to Kafka or Redpanda when you outgrow it.
